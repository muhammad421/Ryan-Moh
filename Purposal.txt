Ryan and I will be working on a past project. The project is a Mario platformer. So far we are able to get our characters ineteracting with the 
grid and, we are able to use text files to edit our levels. Our first priority is to have the characters interact with one another. Than we will
work on making it so that it will look like traditional mario, with the "camera" following mario. After that we will work on making the levels.
And finally we will make it so that the graphics look better and it doesn't look so "blocky". If we have time we will add more enemy characters,
such as Yoshi, the flower, etc. and maybe add a multiplayer. And if we STILL have time we will add power ups, like the mushroom, and flower power.
